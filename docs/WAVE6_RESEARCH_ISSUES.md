## Antes de publicar (checklist)

1. **Crear el label `research`** en el repo (es el único nuevo). Color sugerido: morado.
   `gh label create research --description "Market/user validation — no code, no PR" --color 8957e5`
2. Confirmar que existen los labels: `wave:docs`, `complexity: low`, `Stellar Wave`.
3. Publicar los 5 issues con el cuerpo de abajo. No requieren milestone.
4. No asignar a un solo contribuidor de forma exclusiva: cada respuesta estructurada es válida.

## Principio de privacidad (va en CADA issue)

> ⚠️ **Privacy-first — do not share personal or sensitive data.** No real names, phone
> numbers, addresses, wallet addresses, private keys, documents, receipts, transaction

# V-1 · [Research] Market validation: cash-out context

**Labels:** `research` · `wave:docs` · `complexity: low` · `Stellar Wave`
**Type:** Research issue — no code, no pull request.

### Objective
Understand whether converting digital balance (remittance / crypto / digital money) into
**physical cash** is a real, recurring problem worth solving.

**Validates (SDF angle):** user-side **demand** for cash-out on Stellar.
→ Metric: % of respondents reporting cash-out as a recurring need, and their top friction.

### What to answer (copy this template into a comment and fill it in)
```
- Country / general region:
- How often you (or people you know) need to turn digital money into cash: (e.g. weekly / monthly / rarely)
- Current method you use: (ATM, exchange, a person, a shop, Western Union, etc.)
- Main friction today: (fee / time / trust / liquidity / safety / availability)
- One short anonymized story of a time this was painful:
```

### Acceptance criteria
- A complete, structured answer following the template above.
- No sensitive personal data (see privacy principle).
- Tagged for aggregate analysis (maintainer adds friction/trust notes on close).

### Out of scope
- Specific product feedback (that's V-4 / V-5).
- Any personal identifiers or amounts of money.

# V-2 · [Research] Market validation: cash-in / deposit context

**Labels:** `research` · `wave:docs` · `complexity: low` · `Stellar Wave`
**Type:** Research issue — no code, no pull request.

### Objective
Understand whether putting **physical cash into a digital wallet / balance** solves a real
pain — the reverse direction of V-1.

**Validates (SDF angle):** the problem is **bidirectional** (cash-in too), widening the
addressable use case beyond cash-out.
→ Metric: % with a real cash-in use case, and their main trust barrier.

### What to answer (copy this template into a comment and fill it in)
```
- Country / general region:
- Use case where you'd want to deposit cash into a wallet: (top up, save, pay online, send to family, etc.)
- Current method you use today (if any):
- How often: (weekly / monthly / rarely)
- Trust barriers: what would make you hesitate to hand cash to an agent/shop?
- Availability: are there nearby people/shops you'd trust for this? (yes / no / not sure)
```

### Acceptance criteria
- A complete, structured answer following the template above.
- No sensitive personal data (see privacy principle).
- Tagged for aggregate analysis.

### Out of scope
- Specific product UI feedback (that's V-4 / V-5).
- Any personal identifiers or amounts of money.

# V-3 · [Research] Market validation: liquidity provider perspective

**Labels:** `research` · `wave:docs` · `complexity: low` · `Stellar Wave`
**Type:** Research issue — no code, no pull request.

> Context: MicoPay is **role-agnostic** — any user can act as a liquidity provider (the
> person who hands over cash and earns a commission), there is no separate "merchant" app.

### Objective
Validate whether a regular user or a small business would be willing to act as a
**liquidity provider** (the human cash point).

**Validates (SDF angle):** the **supply side** — that real people/businesses would provide
liquidity, so the P2P network can actually function (not just demand with no one to serve it).
→ Metric: % willing to be a provider, and the acceptable commission % range.

### What to answer (copy this template into a comment and fill it in)
```
- Country / general region:
- Would you consider providing liquidity (giving cash, receiving digital balance)? (yes / no / maybe)
- If a small business: general type (shop, pharmacy, food, services…). If an individual: skip.
- Main motivation: (extra income, foot traffic, helping neighbors, curiosity…)
- Perceived risks: (fake payment, robbery, legal, not getting paid, reputation…)
- Commission you'd expect to charge: (as a %, e.g. 1–3%)
- What would make you trust the system enough to try it once:
```

### Acceptance criteria
- A complete, structured answer following the template above.
- No sensitive personal data (see privacy principle).
- Tagged for aggregate analysis.

### Out of scope
- Onboarding UX feedback (that's V-4).
- Any personal identifiers or amounts of money.

# V-4 · [Research] Product validation: non-custodial wallet onboarding

**Labels:** `research` · `wave:docs` · `complexity: low` · `Stellar Wave`
**Type:** Research issue — no code, no pull request.

> Context: MicoPay is **non-custodial**. The wallet (a Stellar keypair) is created on the
> user's own device; the private key never leaves the phone. The user is responsible for
> backing up their key.

### Objective
Validate whether a typical user understands **creating/importing a wallet** and the
**responsibility of backing it up**, and what would make that step feel trustworthy.

**Validates (SDF angle):** that Stellar's **non-custodial model is usable by mainstream
users**, not only crypto-native people — a key adoption question for self-custody on Stellar.
→ Metric: % who find the key-backup responsibility clear vs confusing, and what builds trust.

### How to participate
Look at the onboarding/registration flow (or the description above) and answer below. If you
run the app locally, do **not** share your real keys, addresses, or screenshots containing them.

### What to answer (copy this template into a comment and fill it in)
```
- Is it clear that YOU hold the key and YOU must back it up? (clear / confusing / why)
- Biggest doubt or fear about a non-custodial wallet:
- What text, step, or reassurance would make you trust this onboarding:
- Preference: create a new wallet vs import an existing Stellar key — which and why:
- Should backing up the key be mandatory during sign-up, or optional? Why:
```

### Acceptance criteria
- Actionable feedback following the template above.
- No keys, personal addresses, or screenshots with sensitive data.
- Tagged for aggregate analysis.

### Out of scope
- The cash-in/cash-out flow trust (that's V-5).
- Backend/auth implementation details.

# V-5 · [Research] Product validation: trust in the cash-in/cash-out flow

**Labels:** `research` · `wave:docs` · `complexity: low` · `Stellar Wave`
**Type:** Research issue — no code, no pull request.

### Objective
Validate whether a user would **trust** the core flow: pick a liquidity provider, see the
commission, use a QR/receipt, and complete the operation.

**Validates (SDF angle):** **trust / product-market fit** in the end-to-end experience —
whether real users would actually adopt it, not just like the idea.
→ Metric: top trust blockers and the top reason users would abandon the flow.

### How to participate
Walk through the flow (choose provider → see fee → QR/receipt → complete) in the app or from
the description, and answer below.

### What to answer (copy this template into a comment and fill it in)
```
- At which point would you trust the flow most? Least?
- Minimum information you need to SEE before handing over money/cash:
- Signals that would make a provider feel "verified" and trustworthy:
- What support/help would you expect if something goes wrong mid-operation:
- Top reason you might ABANDON the flow before finishing:
```

### Acceptance criteria
- Actionable feedback following the template above, with friction/trust points identified.
- No sensitive personal data (see privacy principle).
- Tagged for aggregate analysis.

### Out of scope
- Wallet onboarding (that's V-4).
- Pricing/economics model design.
